# 3D printing

## Slicing software variables

### Raft

A raft attaches your print to the build plate and improves stability. 
When in doubt, use it. 

### Support

Cura or other slicing software can make printing supports automatically. 
A better way is often to design models that don't need support, or make the required support yourself.

### Print head size

0.4mm is the standard size of the printer in the library. 
That's fairly big, i.e. prints fairly fast. 
Print head size can matter when you design small details on your models - a 1.0mm thick wall, for example, will print no different than a 0.8mm thick wall.
A 0.3mm thick wall will not print at all.

## Model problems

Designing models is an iterative process.
You often go several rounds with test prints before you are happy with what you have made. 

#### Lack of support

#### Thin walls

#### Gcode errors
