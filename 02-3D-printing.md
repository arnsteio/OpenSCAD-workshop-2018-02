### Raft

A raft attaches your print to the build plate and improves stability. 
When in doubt, use it.

A better way is often to design models that don't need support, or make the required support yourself.

### Print head size

### Layer height

## The environment

## Servicing the printer

### Changing colour

### Printer problems

## Model problems

Designing models is an iterative process.
You often go several rounds with test prints before you are happy with what you have made. 

#### Lack of support

#### Thin walls

#### Gcode errors
