# Basic OpenSCAD operations
## Shapes

Open OpenScad, and try this:
~~~
cube([50, 10, 5],center=true);
~~~
Press the F5 key to render your code. "cube" is self explanatury, and the numbers give the lengths - X, Y and Z - of the described shape. "center" means the figure will be centered in the origin of the coordinate system as opposed to in the first quadrant (try both if you want).

Now add to the above:
~~~
cube([50, 10, 5],center=true);
cylinder(d1=20, d2=40, center=true);
~~~
Again, press F5 to render.

We can continue doing this - try e.g.
~~~
cube([50, 10, 5],center=true);
cylinder(d1=20, d2=40, center=true);
sphere(r =20);
~~~
However, we need to be able to combine these to make interesting shapes.
