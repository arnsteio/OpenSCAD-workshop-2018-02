# OpenSCAD workshop, University of Oslo, 2018-02
---
Workshop name: 3D design and 3D printing

Instructors: Arnstein Orten

Helpers: Have one probable helper, one in addition would be nice.

Length: 3 hours

Description: 
Most of the time will be spent writing OpenSCAD code. 
If you want to make models with precise measurements, specific tolerances, moving parts, or ones that use mathematical or procedural information, then OpenSCAD is one of your best free design options. 
OpenSCAD is great at making parametric designs — models represented by numbers that can be easily adjusted to change the size, shape, or any other aspect of a design. 

The workshop will give the participant experience designing 3D models in OpenSCAD, and preparing them for printing with Cura. 
It will demonstrate use of the 3D printer that Realfagsbiblioteket has available for lending.

Subjects covered:
- Writing OpenSCAD code
- Getting others’ code, sharing your code
- Exporting and importing from STL
- Preparing STLs for printing with Cura
- Printing on Ultimaker 2+ extruder printer

Learning outcomes:
- Able to design models with OpenSCAD
- Able to print models on extruders

Target audience: 
Attendees should have experience with writing formatted text (html, XML, LaTeX or even the command line). 
Programming experience is helpful but not necessary.  
We will do some maths (rotational objects and trigonometry), having high school math (1. klasse videregående) will help understanding.

Number of attendees: 30

# Course content:
1. [Intro](01-intro.md)
2. [3D-printing](02-3D-printing.md)
3. [Basic OpenSCAD](03-basicOpenSCAD.md)
4. [Modules](04-modules.md)
5. [Trigonometry, conditionals and loops](05-trigonometry_conditionals_loops.md)
6. [Miscellaneous Functions](06-miscellaneousFunctions.md)

Need a room close to Bjørnehjørnet (for closeness to the 3D printer), need the 3D printer itself booked for the day in the library system, wifi, power, a screen to present on.

## My notes:
TODO:
- Do conditional text-part as demo
- Loop-part as a demo
- Do explicit Thingiverse integration
- Add picture of what we are making (clip)
- Add y-alignment as variable

- Remember to resize code text size!
- Remember to speak what I code!
