# OpenSCAD workshop, University of Oslo, 2018-02
---
Workshop name: 3D design and 3D printing

Instructors: Arnstein Orten

Helpers: Would like a couple, have none.

Length: 3 hours? Or longer, depends how deep we should go.

Description: Most of the time will be spent writing OpenSCAD code. OpenSCAD is great at making parametric designs — models represented by numbers that can be easily adjusted to change the size,
shape, or any other aspect of a design. If you want to make models with precise measurements, specific tolerances, moving parts, or ones that use mathematical or procedural information, then
OpenSCAD is one of your best free design options. OpenSCAD is easy to learn even if you’ve never written code before.

The workshop will give the participant experience designing 3D models in OpenSCAD, and preparing them for printing with Cura. It will demonstrate use of the 3D printer that Realfagsbiblioteket has
available for lending.
Subjects covered:
- Writing OpenSCAD code
- Getting others’ code, sharing your code
- Exporting and importing from STL
- Preparing STLs for printing with Cura
- Printing on Ultimaker 2+ extruder printer

Learning outcomes:
- Able to design models with OpenSCAD
- Able to print models on extruders

# Course content:
1. [Intro](01-intro.md)
2. [3D-printing](02-3D-printing.md)
3. [Basic OpenSCAD](03-basicOpenSCAD.md)
4. [Modules](04-modules.md)
5. [Trigonometry, conditionals and loops](05-trigonometry_conditionals_loops.md)
6. [Miscellaneous Functions](06-miscellaneousFunctions.md)

Target audience: Attendees should have some experience with writing formatted text (html, XML, LaTeX or even the command line). Programming experience is unnecessary.  

Number of attendees: 20 unless I get helpers, 40 if I do.  

Need a room close to Bjørnehjørnet (for closeness to the 3D printer), need the 3D printer itself booked for the day in the library system, wifi, power, a screen to present on.

Time plan:
- 09:00 Intro + print
- 09:45 Basic OpenSCAD
- 10:15 Modules
- 10:30 Trig
- 11:00 Misc
- 11:45 Print
- 12:00 Wrap-up
